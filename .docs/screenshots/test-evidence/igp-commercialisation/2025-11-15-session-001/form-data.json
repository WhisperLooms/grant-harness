    "projectDetailedDescription": "This project will commercialize EMEWs advanced electrochemical metal recovery technology specifically for battery metals (lithium, cobalt, nickel) recovery from Australian e-waste streams. We will install a demonstration-scale EMEW system at a partner recycling facility in Victoria to prove commercial viability at scale. The project includes process optimization, automation integration, and development of circular economy business models. This innovative approach enables efficient recovery of critical minerals essential for Australias battery manufacturing supply chain while reducing environmental impact of e-waste disposal. The technology has been proven at pilot scale and this project represents a critical step toward full commercialization.",
    "expectedOutcomes": "Expected outcomes include: (1) Demonstration of commercial-scale battery metal recovery achieving 95%+ recovery efficiency; (2) Creation of 8-10 new technical jobs; (3) Processing capacity of 500 tonnes/year of e-waste; (4) Recovery of high-purity battery metals worth $2M+ annually; (5) Reduction of 800 tonnes CO2-equivalent emissions annually; (6) Establishment of sustainable business model for circular economy metal recovery; (7) Technology validation enabling expansion to 5+ additional facilities within 3 years.",

  "step6_assessment": {
    "criterion1_nrf_alignment": "Our EMEW battery metal recovery project directly aligns with the NRF Renewables and Enabling Capabilities priority areas. The project addresses critical minerals supply chain sovereignty by enabling domestic recovery of lithium, cobalt, and nickel from e-waste, reducing reliance on imports. Our electrochemical technology represents genuine innovation in metal recovery, achieving 95%+ efficiency versus 60-70% for traditional methods. This transforms battery recycling from waste disposal into strategic resource recovery, supporting Australias transition to renewable energy storage. The project enables industry transformation by proving commercial viability of urban mining, creating a new circular economy sector worth $500M+ annually. We contribute to national sovereignty in critical minerals essential for battery manufacturing, defence applications, and renewable energy infrastructure.",
    "criterion2_capacity": "EMEW Technologies has 10+ years experience commercializing electrochemical systems with 50+ installations globally. Our technical team includes 4 PhDs in electrochemistry, 6 process engineers, and 2 metallurgists with combined 80 years industry experience. We have successfully delivered 3 previous scale-up projects on time and budget. Our governance includes quarterly board reviews, monthly project steering committees, and ISO 9001 quality management. Project management follows stage-gate methodology with defined milestones at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months. Risk management addresses technical, commercial, and regulatory risks with mitigation strategies including pilot testing (months 1-6), partner facility agreement (secured), regulatory pre-approval (initiated), and market validation (3 LOIs from potential customers). Our track record demonstrates proven capability to deliver complex commercialization projects.",
    "criterion3_market": "The Australian battery recycling market is projected to reach $850M by 2030 (CSIRO 2023). Target customers include 12 major e-waste processors, 8 mining companies with tailings containing battery metals, and 4 battery manufacturers establishing Australian operations. Our competitive advantage is 95%+ recovery efficiency, 40% lower operating costs versus hydrometallurgy, and modular scalability. Go-to-market strategy includes demonstration facility (this project), 3 pilot customer agreements (secured LOIs), industry partnerships with Lithium Australia and Cleanaway, and regulatory pathway via NEPM compliance. Revenue projections: Year 1 $2M (demonstration), Year 2 $8M (3 commercial installations), Year 3 $20M (expansion). Grant funding accelerates commercialization by 18-24 months, enabling first-mover advantage in emerging circular economy sector. Commercial outcomes include 5 operating facilities by 2029, creating new export opportunities for recovered metals to Asian battery manufacturers.",
    "criterion4_benefits": "Economic benefits: Creation of 45 direct jobs (8 in project phase, 37 in ongoing operations across 5 facilities by 2029), 120 indirect jobs in supply chain, $15M annual economic impact in Geelong region, export revenue potential $30M annually. Social benefits: Development of specialized skills in electrochemistry and critical minerals processing, establishment of battery metals circular economy hub in regional Victoria, 15 traineeships over 3 years. Environmental benefits: Diversion of 2,500 tonnes annually from landfill, reduction of 4,000 tonnes CO2-equivalent emissions annually versus primary mining, elimination of toxic waste from conventional recycling, recovery of water for reuse (95% recycling rate). Industry transformation: Establishment of Australian critical minerals recovery capability reducing import dependence, creation of new circular economy value chains, support for domestic battery manufacturing sovereignty. All benefits quantified using industry benchmarks and validated by CSIRO impact assessment methodology.",
