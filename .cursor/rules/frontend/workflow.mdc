# Frontend Development Workflow

## Status

**Frontend is not yet implemented.**

[To be completed] 

This workflow file will be updated when frontend development begins.

## Planned Architecture

When frontend implementation starts, it will likely follow these patterns:

**Core Pattern**: [To be completed] 

**Expected Tech Stack**:
- Nextjs
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React/Vue framework)
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Integration with backend RAG agent via API
- Browser-based chat interface

## Future Workflow

When frontend development begins, this file should document:

1. **Architecture Principles**
   - Real-time communication patterns
   - UI framework selection rationale
   - Integration with backend RAG agent

2. **Development Rules**
   - Code organization standards
   - Component structure
   - API integration patterns

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for UI components
   - Integration tests with backend
   - End-to-end user journey tests

4. **Common Patterns**
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Message streaming handling
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Citation display in UI

5. **Development Commands**
   - Local development server
   - Build process
   - Testing commands
   - Deployment process

- **Frontend Folder Structure**: `.cursor/rules/frontend/folder-structure.mdc` - Directory organization (to be updated)
- **Template Agent**: `front/realtime-conversational-agent/` - Google ADK sample for reference
- **Main Development Guide**: `CLAUDE.md` - Repository-wide guidance

## Next Steps

Before implementing frontend:
1. Complete backend RAG agent testing and deployment
2. Define frontend requirements and user flows
3. Evaluate template agent for grant-harness use case fit
4. Select UI framework (if needed beyond vanilla JS)
5. Design real-time communication architecture

**AI Agent Guidance**: Frontend is not yet implemented. When starting frontend development, update this workflow file with actual development patterns following the structure suggested above. Refer to backend workflow (`.cursor/rules/backend/workflow.mdc`) as a template for comprehensive workflow documentation.
