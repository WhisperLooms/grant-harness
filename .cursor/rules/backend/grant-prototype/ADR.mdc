# Architecture Decision Log - Grant Prototype (Phase 1)

<!--
ADR_AGENT_PROTOCOL v1.0

You (the agent) manage this file as the single source of truth for all Grant Prototype tactical ADRs.

NUMBER RANGE CONVENTION
- Platform ADRs: ADR-0001 to ADR-0999 (.cursor/rules/platform/ADR.mdc)
- Frontend ADRs: ADR-1000 to ADR-1999 (.cursor/rules/frontend/ADR.mdc)
- Backend Infrastructure: ADR-2000 to ADR-2049 (.cursor/rules/backend/ADR.mdc)
- Backend Grant Prototype: ADR-2050 to ADR-2099 (.cursor/rules/backend/grant-prototype/ADR.mdc)
- Backend Grant ADK: ADR-2100 to ADR-2499 (.cursor/rules/backend/ADR.mdc)

INVARIANTS
- Keep this exact file structure and headings.
- All ADR entries use H2 headings: "## ADR-XXXX — <Title>" (4-digit zero-padded ID).
- Grant Prototype ADRs MUST use numbers 2050-2099 only.
- Allowed Status values: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- New entries must be appended to the END of the file.
- The Index table between the INDEX markers must always reflect the latest state and be sorted by ID desc (newest on top).
- Each ADR MUST contain: Date, Status, Owner, Context, Decision, Consequences.
- Each ADR must include an explicit anchor `<a id="adr-XXXX"></a>` so links remain stable.

IMPORTANT: These are TACTICAL decisions for Phase 1 prototype only. Many may be superseded by Grant ADK decisions in Phase 2.

HOW TO ADD A NEW ADR
1) Read the whole file.
2) Compute next ID:
   - Scan for headings matching: ^## ADR-(\d{4}) — .+$
   - next_id = (max captured number) + 1, left-pad to 4 digits.
   - Ensure ID is in range 2050-2099.
3) Create a new ADR section using the "New ADR Entry Template" below.
   - Place it AFTER the last ADR section in the file.
   - Add an `<a id="adr-XXXX"></a>` line immediately below the heading.
4) Update the Index (between the INDEX markers):
   - Insert/replace the row for this ADR keeping the table sorted by ID descending.
   - Title in the Index MUST link to the anchor: [<Title>](#adr-XXXX)
   - If this ADR supersedes another: set "Supersedes" in this row, and update that older ADR:
       a) Change its Status to "Superseded"
       b) Add "Superseded by: ADR-XXXX" in its Consequences block
       c) Update the older ADR's Index row "Superseded by" column to ADR-XXXX
5) Validate before saving:
   - Exactly one heading exists for ADR-XXXX
   - All required fields are present and non-empty
   - Index contains a row for ADR-XXXX and remains properly sorted
6) Concurrency resolution:
   - If a merge conflict or duplicate ID is detected after reading: recompute next_id from the current file state, rename your heading, anchor, and Index row accordingly, and retry once.

COMMIT MESSAGE SUGGESTION
- "ADR-XXXX: <Short Title> — <Status>"
