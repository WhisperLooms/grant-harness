4. Is there existing revenue to demonstrate commercial traction?
5. What is the exit strategy?

**Action:** Prepare comprehensive pitch deck if equity investment aligns with growth strategy

---

#### Option 6: NSW HEI (When Reopens 2026)
**Timeline:** 2026 reopening (date TBA)
**Why:**
- $305M program for industrial decarbonisation
- Large funding amounts for deployment projects

**CRITICAL Eligibility Check:**
- Does EMEW emit >90,000 tCO₂-e per year? (Likely NO for SME)
- Does EMEW have NSW manufacturing facility? (Likely Victoria-based)
- If BOTH are NO: **NOT ELIGIBLE**

**Action:** Only pursue if eligibility confirmed; otherwise skip

## Grant Sequencing Strategy

### Recommended Phased Approach

**Phase 1: Validation & Foundation (Months 1-3)**
```
CSIRO Kick-Start ($10-50K)
    ↓ [Generates validation data]
IGP Advisory Service (Free)
    ↓ [Receives IGPAS number + recommendations]
```

**Phase 2: Scale-Up Funding (Months 4-9)**
```
IGP Grant Application ($50K-$5M)
    ↓ [Uses CSIRO validation + Advisory recommendations]
    ↓
ARENA ARP Application ($500K-$50M)
    ↓ [Uses CSIRO + IGP data for larger demonstration/scale-up]
```

**Phase 3: Strategic Growth (Months 10-18)**
```
BBI Application ($1M-$30M) - IF battery focus
    ↓
OR
Breakthrough Victoria ($1M-$15M) - IF equity acceptable
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Key Risks Identified

#### Risk 1: Advisory Service Delay (IGP)
**Impact:** 8-14 week wait before grant eligibility
**Mitigation:** Start Advisory Service immediately while pursuing CSIRO Kick-Start in parallel

#### Risk 2: Co-Funding Requirements
**Impact:** All major grants require 30-50% matched funding
**Mitigation:**
- Secure investor commitments early
- Stage applications (smaller first, larger later)
- Use grant proceeds from smaller programs as co-funding for larger ones

#### Risk 3: Long Application Timelines
**Impact:** 4-9 months from application to funding
**Mitigation:**
- Run multiple applications in parallel
- Maintain cash flow during application period
- Use CSIRO ($10-50K) as bridge funding

#### Risk 4: Eligibility Thresholds
**Impact:** Some programs have specific requirements (e.g., emissions, location)
**Mitigation:**
- Thorough eligibility assessment before investing time
- Focus on programs with confirmed fit
- NSW HEI likely not applicable unless threshold met

#### Risk 5: Technology Readiness Level Alignment
**Impact:** Some programs require specific TRL stages
**Mitigation:**
- IGP Advisory Service helps identify best track (ESC vs. C&G)
- CSIRO Kick-Start validates technology and raises TRL
- Clear understanding of EMEW's current TRL critical

- ⚠️ BTV (competitive pitch process, equity investors)

**EMEW Competitive Advantages:**
- Established technology (reduces risk)
- Clear commercial applications
- Circular economy and environmental benefits
- Manufacturing and resource recovery alignment with National Reconstruction Fund priorities
- Victorian location (access to state programs)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive grant review has identified a clear pathway for EMEW to access **$100K to $60M+** in government funding across multiple programs. The strategic recommendation is a **phased approach** starting with immediate actions (CSIRO Kick-Start, IGP Advisory) that build validation and credibility for larger funding applications (ARP, BBI).

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Act immediately** on CSIRO Kick-Start (rolling applications, fast process)
2. **Start IGP Advisory Service** within 2 weeks (mandatory prerequisite)
3. **Secure co-funding commitments** early (30-50% required for major grants)
4. **Run applications in parallel** to maximize funding opportunities
5. **Use smaller grants** to validate technology for larger applications

**Expected Timeline to First Funding:**
- CSIRO Kick-Start: 2-3 months
- IGP: 6-9 months
- ARP: 6-12 months
- BBI: 12-18 months (August 2025 launch)

**Total Grant Preparation Investment Required:**
- Time: ~100-200 hours (spread over 3-6 months)
- Cash for co-funding: $5K-$50K for initial applications (scales with program size)
- Professional support: Consider grant consultant for major applications ($10-50K)

With EMEW's established technology, clear market need, and strong alignment with National Reconstruction Fund priorities (Value-add in Resources), the company is well-positioned to successfully secure multiple grants to accelerate growth and market expansion.
